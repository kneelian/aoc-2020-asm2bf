# aoc-2020-asm2bf
Advent of Code 2020 in asm2bf

Compiled without special tricks using only `perl ./bfmake ./aoc-dXsY.asm`, where `X` represents the day and `Y` the part of the day.

Based on the wonderful toolchain and language by @kspalaiologos: https://github.com/kspalaiologos/asmbf. All other code is my own.
